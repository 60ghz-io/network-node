# initscript    If this script is intalled as /etc/initscript,
#               it is executed by init(8) for every program it
#               wants to spawn like this:
#
#               /bin/sh /etc/initscript <id> <level> <action> <process>
#
#               It can be used to set the default umask and ulimit
#               of all processes. By default this script is installed
#               as /etc/initscript.sample, so to enable it you must
#               rename this script first to /etc/initscript.

# Enable core dumps
ulimit -c unlimited
eval exec "$4"
